## Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year Computer Science student passionate about building innovative tech solutions. My journey so far has been a blend of coding, exploring AI, diving into IoT, and creating impactful projects. Whether it's crafting efficient algorithms, automating tasks with AI, or working on real-world problems through IoT systems, I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of technology.

Check out my repositories for projects ranging from machine learning models to full-stack applications. I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new tech stacks, and I love collaborating on open-source projects. Letâ€™s connect and code something awesome.
